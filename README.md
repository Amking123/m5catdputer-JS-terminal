in the terminal you can run JS files but you have to make a folder in the root of your micro SD card the name should be apps
there is also a menu.h that in the terminal by typing menu you can use it its demo 
the terminal is also demo too but it works
also if you want to use the menu option you need to add the .js file in the apps and type the name of the app in the menu too then if you go to the menu section you can run the app but be careful in the menu section to run or select an app you need to press space but in terminal its enter
